# DLMS-using-SOAP-Service
Distributed library management system using Java JAXWS package(SOAP style).

This time it's JAXWS-SOAP technology flavour which is added to DLMS bucket. This Project is similar to DLMS-using-Java-RMI(https://github.com/y0geshchaudhary/DLMS-using-Java-RMI) in terms of funtionality but with one more similar feature added to it and another different is that in this project we are using JAXWS package of Java to enable SOAP WS based communication between client-server.
